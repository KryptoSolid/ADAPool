1. 12xcore processor
2. 64GB RAM

Separate BPM and relay. All attempts are made to ensure system availability and security, feel free to open an issue in case anything needs a fix.

Cheers!


## About Me

I am an IT security professional and also owner of a big data financial services solution (which processes approx 5M messages per day). Have experience maintaining secure and resilient systems, some of them having an uptime of 1000+ days without disruption. 
Got recently into Cardano and saw quite a lot of big pools, and I think it's really good as long as the community operates these. But eventually, this structure will attract corporate entities that may monopolize the system. My interests are aligned more towards community participation, decentralization and privacy. After all these are the things that make crypto resilient against problems that existing financial systems face. 


## About the pool

Krypto Solid (KSO) is the only pool operated by me. I chose this name because the pool will be reliable and want it to be aligned for the greater good of community, probably once dapps are supported, I'd contribute to them as well. Happy Staking!
